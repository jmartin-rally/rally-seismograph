=================

Keep track of your teams energy level over a quarter.   This pair of apps also demonstrates how to have one Rally panel's app affect another Rally panel's app. 

Here's a screencast:

The selection of users to show on the graph is dependent on Team Membership for the scoped project and whether or not the team member has entered any data.  

You'll have to create two panels -- one is for displaying the chart and one is for modifying the data.  This way, you can put a small version of the chart on your dashboard or you can make a whole page for entry and display of the data.

Lots of other things could be done with this (allow for changing the date range, allow annotation of the dates during a retro, overlay some sprint or story information), but I'm not sure what's the next most interesting thing to do.  So feel free to jump in or suggest.
